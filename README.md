I am a Junior Software Engineer, recently completed [Makers Academy Bootcamp](#makers) and I am looking forward to continue learning and growing as a developer. I have a background in both healthcare and non-profit organisations and therefore hope to work for a mission-led and value driven company who are committed to bringing positive change. I hope to contribute to big projects as part of a fun, supportive team where I can learn from people of all walks of life.<br>

**Motivated to learn**
- I feel passionate about continuous learning and exploring new and different ways of doing things and I am able to adapt to change. The broad range of projects in my previous career required adaptability to the required specifications as well as a willingness to explore other solutions.
- When working as an Emergency call coordinator during the pandemic, a time weere little understanding of the virus. I had to adapt quickly and aid in triaging and organising of ambulances to ensure patients were not neglected during unprecedented times. I had to study new notes given by the clinical team and relay it to other healthcare professionals who were calling.
- In the context of Makers, we discussed our goals for the final project and our team decided on working with REACT. With no prior knowledge of React, I was able to overcome the challenge of learning the new framework within a few days and contribute as an active member of the team. I was able to implement a two player and game assist functionality.

<br> 

**Team work**
- Working as part of multidiscplinary team within the London Ambulance service, there is a shared purpose to improve patient outcome.The experience of working in these environments has set me up with tools for collaboration, from communication skills, open-mindedness, to being able to take different roles within teams, like leading in the arrangement of ambulances to training new colleagues in both  thecall handling and dispatch sector.
- My role as a community coordinator for CodeYourFuture has given me the opportunity to both lead and support ongoing projects.I Helped organised a women's brunch at CodeYourFuture to help empower women who come from varying social backgrounds to forge a career in technology. As the team were working mainly remotely, it took substantial coordination and keeping an open mind to different ways of communicating instead of the traditional face to face meetings. In addition to video conferencing, I relied heavily on active email exchanges, using tools such as trello and canvas to organise the event. 
-I thoroughly enjoy working with others and pair programming was a significant component of the Makers Academy program where I paired with a colleague on a challenge every afternoon.
<br> 

**Problem solving**
- Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the London ambulance service, problem solving is a main aspect of the profession. At any stage of the shift changes are possible and inevitable, from change in condition of the patient, unexpected work conditions, ambulance delays, staff shortage. An ability to react to those challenges and being able to prioritise and turn around a solution promptly is essential and at times requires unconventional approaches.
